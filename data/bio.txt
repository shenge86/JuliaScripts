Creative and entrepreneurial, I'm proficient and passionate in space mission design, physics simulations, data analysis, and lunar imagery as well as project management, technical writing and education. I presently work on the flight dynamics team for lunar exploration on the Intuitive Machines lunar projects. I worked TRAJ console shift for the Intuitive Machines first lunar mission which successfully landed on the moon in February 2024. I'm currently working on the second lunar mission which will launch early 2025.

In August 2018, I attained the 35 Under 35 award presented by the International Institute of Space Commerce (IISC). In the past, I was also extremely active in the local AIAA Houston chapter and have attained volunteering and journalism awards there.

I also presently run a weekly space radio show, previously hosted on Action One Media but now on my own platform. In my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction and web novels, playing video games, coding and writing. Some key links:
